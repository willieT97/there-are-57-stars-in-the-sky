      <h1>Fortnite – A World To Aspire To</h1>
      <p class="post-date">Posted on June 24, 2025</p>

      <p>I clicked on my brother’s Playstation and installed Fortnite. As a 27 year old man I thought the gaming part of my life was over. I was never really a gamer per se, just playing Fifa when I wasn’t outside playing soccer. My friend, an avid gamer, had asked me if I wanted to play Fortnite with him. Playing with, meaning, playing alone in a room, with my phone on the desk so that we could be on a Whatsapp call together. How modern. He guided me through the maze of the Fortnite start menu. (I had accidentally ended up in a Minecraft style world from which he had to collect me, like a parent)</p>

      <p>The sheer size of the world astounded me like the time I went to Lego Land as a child. I thought to myself, how can this game possibly be free? Surely, countless human hours were spent building this game. In fact, it is not a game. It is a collection of games. How many hours were devoted to coding, designing, debugging this colossus? How do they make that money back and turn a profit? I let this question sit.</p>

      <p>We entered into the map, as a duo. Me, the stock male character and him, a stylish slim woman with a spider-woman mask. This was a one sided duo but it was a duo nonetheless. Dropping into an abandoned section of the map, he showed me how to jump, shoot, and collect items. The hyper-real colours and the shimmering sounds, I must admit, were intoxicating. I soon got to grips with how things work though I was woefully underprepared for any type of skirmish. We marauded through the map, mostly in a car, me riding shotgun (excuse the pun). I attempted many times to aim and fire at enemies from this position but failed each time. Each character bounding across the screen seemed equally evasive.</p>

      <p>I noticed that there is a vast array of characters and styles in the game. I, of course, started with the most basic character, a broadly built man with hair brushed up into peaks. My friend, the masked woman I mentioned earlier. This is something I commented on to him, though, it didn’t occur to me at the time how important this was. These accessories and character aesthetics are, in fact, the financial model of the game. They are also important signals as to one’s status as a seasoned player. You can have the whole game for free, however, you will be a nobody. You will look basic, everyone will know you are a nube. This strikes at one of the most potent and prevalent insecurities, the need to be special. What good is the game if I simply look like everyone else who plays, if I am unimportant, if I just look like an NPC.</p>

      <p>“Stop! Don’t shoot them.”, my friend said. It was too late. I had shot the in-game NPCs after which they sprung into action, charging and shooting at us. We survived with some damage, though I was confused at how I was to know which characters were computer controlled and which were human controlled. If I stayed completely still would other players assume that I was an NPC? Is this a potential strategy for winning the game? There is something pathetic about this though, to mold oneself after an NPC, to be confused for a computer controlled being, to reverse Turing test oneself. I am told that being called an NPC in gaming culture is a particularly nasty insult (apparently main character syndrome is almost as bad. You just can’t win). To be confused for a computer simulation is to be worthless, valueless, and banal. The flip side of this coin is that one’s value is found in their humanness. A romantic implication embedded in gaming culture. It is this romantic notion which is the foundation of Fortnite’s money making enterprise. Buy this hat for your character because it looks cool. You really need this new skin. Oh did you see that you can buy the new Nike runner in game for your Fortnite character.</p>

      <p>This idea that one’s in game character is an extension of one’s own identity, or a vessel for identity experimentation is something that seems very natural to the younger generations, not so much to the older generations. Those who grew up with the internet have been making digital copies of themselves since primary school. Make an account for this or that, and upload a picture or image that represents you. Play Minecraft/ Roblox/ Fortnite and create your own character which will represent you to others. This is your face in a kind of public sphere. Schools even encourage this with ClassDojo in which children have to select a picture that represents them for their class account (ClassDojo is a software used to reward/punish children based on a points system). Our parents’ generation, and the generations before did not have to construct digital identities. Their identities were inseparable from their personhood. How does one feel worthy in this act of selected identity. When I choose my picture or animation for ClassDojo what must I choose to identify myself. Will I just pick the stock image? Will I just be an NPC?</p>

      <p>NPCs in a different form are springing into existence even in our own reality. Bots are everywhere on social media, language models have passed the Turing test, AI can produce videos which appear to be real, speech models are very convincing. Right now, we live in a sandbox world surrounded by NPCs. How do I know when conversing with my friend on Whatsapp that they are not a convincing replica conjured up from Meta’s AI models? How do I know that the anonymous person with whom I am arguing on Reddit is not a modified version of chatGPT created to sow mutual distrust. Like in Fortnite we will find ways of distinguishing ourselves from them. Whether that be a glorification of uniqueness or by some other means. We will find some way to scream out for humanity as it drowns in the static of artificially generated copies.</p>

      <p>This world of Fortnite was an unnerving place to be for me. Who was real there? I couldn’t help but be flung into this epistemological desert. ‘Descartes save me’. At least I know I am real in this simulation. What does it mean to be real when I am looking at pixels on a screen and I see it as a world inhabited by cartoon-like characters. The map is flat, at least they got something right… Who are these people I am playing with? Are they people I know? Are they strangers from halfway across the globe? What is their world when they shut off the game? How many of them are children? How many of them have children? How many of them are grandparents? Probably not a lot, but you never know.</p>

      <p>Me and my friend played for an hour, perusing through towns, sometimes getting swamped by enemies. Other times tactically outmaneuvering them. To me, these other players may as well have been computers. It was almost impossible for me to find a connection to them. They were anonymous, their in game names are not their real names. Their characters do not necessarily look like them, most probably they look very different. “Right…”, he said “I’ve had enough of this. I’m heading to bed”. “Grand”, I replied. I too had had enough. When I switched off the game I arrived back in my brother’s room, though I had never left it. The room was silent. My friend’s voice was no longer present. The game, the map, these anonymous strangers were gone. The television was blank. The Playstation fan slowed to a stop once I clicked ‘enter rest mode’. I was alone for a brief moment, a moment of chaos, before I decided to listen to Youtube videos to fall asleep.</p>
